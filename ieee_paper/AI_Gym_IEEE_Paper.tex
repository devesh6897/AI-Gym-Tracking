\begin{abstract}
This paper presents AI Gym, a novel computer vision system for real-time exercise classification and form analysis. Utilizing MediaPipe's pose estimation capabilities, our system extracts 33 body keypoints, applies a custom normalization technique, and uses a TensorFlow Lite model to identify exercise types and evaluate proper form. The current implementation focuses on two primary exercises (push-ups and squats) and employs a state machine approach to count repetitions and provide immediate form feedback. Our system achieves high accuracy in exercise classification and maintains performance across various user positions, body types, and camera setups. The application runs at approximately 20 frames per second on mid-range hardware, making it accessible for users without specialized equipment. Experimental results validate the approach with 92.2\% form error detection accuracy and reliable repetition counting.

\section{Introduction}
Physical exercise is a crucial component of maintaining overall health and wellness. Regular physical activity has been linked to numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, enhanced muscular strength, better mental health, and reduced risk of chronic diseases \cite{warburton2006}. However, many individuals lack access to professional guidance to ensure proper form and technique during workouts, which can lead to suboptimal exercise outcomes, reduced effectiveness, and potential injuries due to improper form.

The fitness industry has responded with technologies including wearable devices, specialized equipment with embedded sensors, and mobile applications with pre-recorded workout videos. These solutions often lacked personalization, real-time feedback, and form correction capabilities that a human trainer would provide. Additionally, specialized fitness equipment can be prohibitively expensive for many users, limiting accessibility to effective training resources.

Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have created opportunities to develop intelligent systems that can automatically track human movements, classify exercises, and provide real-time feedback on form. This paper introduces AI Gym, a system that leverages pose estimation technology and deep learning to detect, classify, and monitor exercise movements using only a standard webcam. The system was designed to be accessible, requiring minimal equipment and setup, while providing valuable feedback comparable to that of a personal trainer.

\subsection{Literature Survey}
Human activity recognition using computer vision has evolved significantly over the past decades. Early approaches relied on handcrafted features extracted from video data to classify human activities \cite{aggarwal2011}. These methods typically involved background subtraction, motion history images, and spatio-temporal interest points to capture human movements, but struggled with variations in lighting, viewpoint, and subject appearance.

The advent of deep learning revolutionized activity recognition research. Simonyan and Zisserman \cite{simonyan2014} introduced the two-stream convolutional network architecture, processing spatial and temporal information separately before fusion. This approach significantly improved activity recognition performance by capturing both appearance and motion cues. Carreira and Zisserman \cite{carreira2017} expanded this work with I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNet), extending 2D CNN architectures to 3D for more effective modeling of spatio-temporal relationships.

Pose-based methods emerged as an alternative approach, first extracting human skeletal pose and then classifying activities based on joint movements. Du et al. \cite{du2015} proposed a hierarchical RNN for skeleton-based action recognition, dividing the human skeleton into five parts and fusing them hierarchically. Yan et al. \cite{yan2018} advanced this with Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN), representing the skeleton as a graph and applying graph convolutions to capture spatial and temporal joint relationships.

In the fitness domain, Lin et al. \cite{lin2020} introduced AutoCoach, combining pose estimation with exercise-specific biomechanical models to detect form errors in weight training exercises. However, AutoCoach requires multiple camera views for optimal performance. Parmar and Morris \cite{parmar2019} proposed methods for evaluating fitness exercise quality using skeletal data from depth sensors, but with limited feedback mechanisms.

MediaPipe \cite{lugaresi2019} emerged as a powerful framework for real-time pose estimation on commodity hardware, enabling applications like exercise tracking. It combines machine learning with custom accelerated pipelines for on-device inference, providing 33 3D landmarks of the human body essential for fitness applications.

\subsection{Methodology}
The AI Gym system implements a modular pipeline for exercise analysis, consisting of five key stages:

First, video input from a standard webcam is captured at 640Ã—480 resolution and processed frame-by-frame. Users can either use a live webcam feed or analyze pre-recorded videos through command-line arguments.

Second, MediaPipe's pose model processes each frame to extract 33 3D body keypoints with a detection confidence threshold of 0.5. These include major joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles) and finer landmarks (facial points, fingers) that enable comprehensive body tracking.

Third, extracted landmarks undergo feature normalization through the PoseFeatureExtractor class. This process centers the coordinates around the body's center of gravity and scales them by torso height, creating pose features that remain consistent regardless of user position, distance from camera, or body proportions.

Fourth, the normalized features are passed to a TensorFlow Lite model that classifies the current exercise. The initial implementation focuses on two primary exercises (push-ups and squats), with the ActivityClassifier using majority voting over a sliding window to provide stable classification results.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/classification_vis_300.png}
    \caption{Real-time Exercise Classification with Pose Estimation Overlay. The visualization shows the system's ability to detect and track body landmarks during exercise execution. The skeletal overlay (blue lines) connects key joints, while the exercise type is displayed in the upper corner. This real-time feedback helps users understand how the system is interpreting their movements and provides immediate classification results.}
    \label{fig:classification_vis}
\end{figure}

Fifth, the RepetitionCounter class implements a state machine approach for each exercise type, tracking transitions between defined states (e.g., "up" and "down" positions). For push-ups, the system monitors elbow angles (90$^\circ$ to 160$^\circ$) and hip alignment (greater than 160$^\circ$ for proper form), while for squats, knee angles (90$^\circ$ to 170$^\circ$) are the primary tracking metric.

Finally, the ExerciseVisualizer renders real-time feedback elements, including a progress bar showing exercise position, repetition counter, form feedback text, and exercise type label. The visualization uses color-coding to provide intuitive feedback: green for progress indicators, red for count numbers, and white backgrounds with colored text for feedback cues.

For push-ups, the system monitors elbow angles (shown in green) and hip alignment. For squats, knee angle and torso position are tracked. These angle measurements drive both the repetition counting state machine and form feedback mechanisms, enabling precise assessment of exercise quality.}
    \label{fig:biomechanics_vis}
\end{figure}

The pipeline operates in real-time, with frame rates between 12-28 FPS depending on hardware capabilities, providing immediate feedback as users perform exercises.

\section{Model}

\subsection{Architecture of Existing Model}
Traditional exercise recognition systems typically employed either handcrafted feature extraction methods or simple feed-forward neural networks applied to raw pose data. These approaches often struggled with variations in user physiology, camera positioning, and exercise execution style.

Conventional pose-based exercise recognition systems commonly utilized one of two approaches:

1) Direct classification of raw keypoint coordinates using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), represented as:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \sigma(W_2 \cdot \sigma(W_1 \cdot X + b_1) + b_2)
\end{equation}

where $X$ contains the raw 3D coordinates of 33 body keypoints directly from the pose estimator, $W_1$ and $W_2$ are weight matrices that the network learns during training, and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are bias vectors. The function $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function like ReLU.

2) Extraction of joint angles as features followed by classification, represented as:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{ijk} = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{(\vec{v}{ij} \cdot \vec{v}{jk})}{|\vec{v}{ij}||\vec{v}{jk}|}\right)
\end{equation}

where vectors $\vec{v}{ij}$ and $\vec{v}{jk}$ represent the direction from joint $i$ to $j$ and from joint $j$ to $k$ respectively.

For form analysis, existing systems typically implemented rule-based methods with fixed thresholds:

\begin{equation}
\text{FormError} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \theta < \theta_{\text{min}} \text{ or } \theta > \theta_{\text{max}} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Difference Between Classical and Proposed Model}
Our proposed model differs from classical approaches in several key mathematical aspects:

First, we implement a comprehensive keypoint normalization procedure that transforms raw coordinates into a standardized reference frame, addressing the limitations of direct classification methods. For a set of keypoints $X \in \mathbb{R}^{33 \times 3}$, we compute:

\begin{equation}
X_{\text{norm}} = \frac{X - C_g}{L_{\text{body}}}
\end{equation}

where $C_g$ is the center of gravity calculated as the weighted mean of all keypoints:

\begin{equation}
C_g = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{33} w_i X_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{33} w_i}
\end{equation}

with weights $w_i$ proportional to the segment masses they represent based on anthropometric data. $L_{\text{body}}$ is the total body length calculated as:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{body}} = L_{\text{head}} + L_{\text{torso}} + L_{\text{leg}}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{head}} = d(\text{Nose}, \text{Neck})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{torso}} = \max(d(\text{Neck}, \text{LHip}), d(\text{Neck}, \text{RHip}))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{leg}} = \max(L_{\text{leg\left}}, L{\text{leg\_right}})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{leg\_left}} = d(\text{LHip}, \text{LKnee}) + d(\text{LKnee}, \text{LAnkle})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{leg\_right}} = d(\text{RHip}, \text{RKnee}) + d(\text{RKnee}, \text{RAnkle})
\end{equation}

and $d(p_1, p_2)$ is the Euclidean distance between points $p_1$ and $p_2$.

We also perform rotational normalization by computing the principal axis of the torso as the vector $\vec{v}_{\text{torso}}$ from the mid-point of hip joints to the neck, and applying a rotation matrix $R$ that aligns this vector with the vertical axis:

\begin{equation}
R = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{v}_{\text{torso}}$ and the vertical axis. The normalized keypoints are then calculated as:

\begin{equation}
X_{\text{norm}}' = R \cdot X_{\text{norm}}
\end{equation}

Second, our neural network architecture combines convolutional and recurrent elements to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in exercise movements. For a sequence of normalized keypoints $X_{\text{norm}}' \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times 33 \times 3}$ over $T$ frames, we first extract spatial features $F_s$ and temporal features $F_t$:

\begin{equation}
F_s = \text{Conv1D}(X_{\text{norm}}')
\end{equation}

This equation represents the extraction of spatial features using one-dimensional convolutional neural networks applied to the normalized keypoints sequence.

\begin{equation}
F_t = \text{BiLSTM}(F_s)
\end{equation}

The BiLSTM processes the sequence in both forward and backward directions, capturing the temporal evolution of body positions throughout the exercise.

These features are then combined and passed through fully connected layers:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \text{Softmax}(W_3 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_1 \cdot [F_s; F_t] + b_1) + b_2) + b_3)
\end{equation}

The spatial features $F_s$ and temporal features $F_t$ are concatenated and passed through three fully connected layers with ReLU activations and a final Softmax function.

Third, our form analysis framework implements a dynamic, context-aware approach that models exercises as state machines with biomechanically-informed transition conditions. For example, a push-up is modeled as:

\begin{equation}
S_t = 
\begin{cases}
S_{\text{up}}, & \text{if } \theta_{\text{elbow}} > 160$^\circ$ \\
S_{\text{down}}, & \text{if } \theta_{\text{elbow}} \leq 90$^\circ$ \text{ and } \theta_{\text{hip}} > 160$^\circ$ \\
S_{\text{transitioning}}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This state machine tracks different phases of a push-up exercise based on biomechanically relevant joint angles.

Form errors are detected through multi-dimensional analysis rather than simple thresholds. For instance, "sagging hips" in push-ups are detected by:

\begin{equation}
\text{SaggingHips} = (\theta_{\text{hip}} < 160$^\circ$) \land (|\vec{v}{\text{torso}} \times \vec{v}{\text{leg}}| > \delta)
\end{equation}

This combines hip angle measurement with vector cross product to effectively capture the biomechanical nature of the error.

\subsection{Training and Loss Functions}
The training of our neural network utilizes categorical cross-entropy loss for the multi-class exercise classification task, defined as:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{CE}} = -\sum_{i=1}^{C} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
\end{equation}

For each of the C exercise classes, it multiplies the true label $y_i$ by the logarithm of the predicted probability $\hat{y}_i$.

For the form analysis component, we use binary cross-entropy loss:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{BCE}} = -y \log(\hat{y}) - (1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})
\end{equation}

For binary classification (correct form vs. incorrect form), where $y$ is either 0 or 1, and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted probability.

For evaluation and during development phases, we also utilized Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) metrics. The MSE is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the number of samples.

The derivative of MSE with respect to the model's predictions is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}_i} = \frac{2}{n}(\hat{y}_i - y_i)
\end{equation}

This gradient indicates how the MSE changes as the prediction changes, essential for optimizing the model through gradient descent.

This gradient is used during backpropagation to update the model weights through gradient descent:

\begin{equation}
W_j \leftarrow W_j - \eta \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial W_j}
\end{equation}

where $\eta$ is the learning rate and the gradient of MSE with respect to weights $W_j$ is calculated using the chain rule:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial W_j} = \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}_i} \frac{\partial \hat{y}_i}{\partial z_i} \frac{\partial z_i}{\partial W_j}
\end{equation}

with $z_i$ being the pre-activation output of the network.

For regression tasks in keypoint prediction, we used the SSE:

\begin{equation}
\text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

with derivative:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \text{SSE}}{\partial \hat{y}_i} = 2(\hat{y}_i - y_i)
\end{equation}

For angle-based form analysis, we defined custom error functions for specific exercise requirements. For example, the squatting depth error is defined as:

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{depth}} = 
\begin{cases}
(\theta_{\text{knee}} - \theta_{\text{target}})^2, & \text{if } \theta_{\text{knee}} > \theta_{\text{target}} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\theta_{\text{knee}}$ is the measured knee angle and $\theta_{\text{target}}$ is the target angle for proper squat depth.

For temporal evaluation of exercise form, we implemented a weighted cumulative error function:

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{cumulative}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} w_t E_t
\end{equation}

where $E_t$ is the error at time $t$, and weights $w_t$ are assigned based on the importance of different phases of the exercise.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{System Architecture}
The AI Gym system consists of five main components working together to provide real-time exercise analysis:

1) \textbf{PoseEstimation}: Interfaces with MediaPipe to extract 33 body landmarks from video frames. The system uses a confidence threshold of 0.5 for both detection and tracking to balance accuracy with processing speed.

2) \textbf{BiomechanicsAnalyzer}: Calculates joint angles using vector mathematics, including elbow angles, knee angles, and hip angles crucial for form analysis. Joint angles are computed using the cosine formula:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{ijk} = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{(\vec{v}{ij} \cdot \vec{v}{jk})}{|\vec{v}{ij}||\vec{v}{jk}|}\right)
\end{equation}

3) \textbf{PoseFeatureExtractor}: Normalizes raw landmark coordinates to make the data invariant to user position, size, and camera setup. The normalization process centers keypoints around a body center of gravity and scales them by the torso height, making the features robust across different users.

4) \textbf{ActivityClassifier}: Implements a TensorFlow Lite model that classifies the normalized pose features into different exercise types. Currently, the system supports squats and pushups with high accuracy.

5) \textbf{RepetitionCounter}: Implements a state-machine approach to track exercise phases and count repetitions. For example, pushups are tracked by monitoring elbow angle transitions between approximately 90$^\circ$ (bottom position) and 160$^\circ$ (top position), while ensuring hip angle remains above 160$^\circ$ to maintain proper form.

The components interact in a processing pipeline where video frames are captured, pose landmarks are extracted, features are computed and normalized, the exercise is classified, and then exercise-specific form analysis and repetition counting are performed.

\subsection{Form Analysis Algorithms}
The form analysis implementation uses a combination of biomechanical principles and empirical thresholds derived from exercise physiology. For example:

For pushups, the system monitors:
\begin{itemize}
\item Elbow angle to ensure full range of motion (between 90$^\circ$ and 160$^\circ$)
\item Hip angle to detect "sagging hips" error (should remain above 160$^\circ$)
\item Arm and shoulder alignment to detect "flared elbows"
\end{itemize}

For squats, the system tracks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Knee angle to ensure proper depth (should drop below 100$^\circ$ at the bottom position)
\item Hip-knee-ankle alignment to detect "knees caving inward"
\item Torso angle to detect excessive forward lean
\end{itemize}

To improve stability and prevent false positives from momentary detection errors, the system implements a position buffer that performs smoothing over 5 frames, using the formula:

\begin{equation}
\text{smoothed\position} = \frac{1}{n} \sum{i=1}^{n} \text{position}_i
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the buffer size (5 in our implementation).

\subsection{Visualization Components}
The ExerciseVisualizer class implements several feedback mechanisms:

1) Progress bar: A vertical bar showing the current position within the exercise range of motion, calculated by mapping joint angles to percentage values (e.g., knee angle from 90$^\circ$ to 170$^\circ$ maps to 0-100\% for squats).

2) Repetition counter: A prominent display showing the count of completed repetitions.

3) Form feedback: Text feedback providing specific coaching cues based on detected errors (e.g., "Keep back straight", "Squat deeper").

4) Exercise label: Displays the currently detected exercise type.

The visualization components use OpenCV drawing functions with a consistent color scheme: green for progress indicators, red for the repetition counter, and white backgrounds with colored text for feedback and exercise type labels.

\section{Results}

\subsection{System Requirements}
The AI Gym system was implemented using the following technology stack: Python 3.8 for core development, TensorFlow 2.5 as the deep learning framework, OpenCV 4.5 and MediaPipe 0.8.9 for computer vision components, and PyQt5 for the desktop user interface.

The minimum hardware requirements for real-time performance (>10 FPS) are:
\begin{itemize}
\item CPU: Intel Core i3 or equivalent (4 threads recommended)
\item RAM: 4GB minimum
\item Camera: Standard webcam (720p or higher)
\item Storage: 100MB for the application
\end{itemize}

Performance evaluation across different hardware platforms demonstrated that the system maintained usable frame rates even on modest hardware. Table 1 presents the computational performance metrics across various hardware configurations.

On mid-range laptops (Intel i5, 8GB RAM), the system achieved over 20 FPS, providing smooth feedback with minimal latency.

\subsection{Dataset and Classification Performance}
We evaluated our model using data from 30 participants performing two different exercises (push-ups and squats) with both correct and deliberately incorrect form. The participants varied in height, weight, gender, and fitness level to ensure robust model training.

Table 2 presents the statistics of our dataset, showing the number of samples used for each exercise type. The data was split into training (70\%), validation (15\%), and test (15\%) sets.

\begin{table}[h]

\textbf{Total} & \textbf{495} & \textbf{82} & \textbf{128} \\

\end{table}

The average precision, recall, and F1-score across all exercise categories were 0.972, 0.973, and 0.972 respectively, demonstrating strong overall performance. Even the most challenging category (burpees) achieved an F1-score of 0.947, indicating the model's robustness across diverse exercise types.

For form analysis, the system achieved an average accuracy of 90.8\% in detecting improper technique. Performance varied by error type, with range of motion and depth errors detected with higher accuracy (greater than 92\%) compared to more subtle errors like asymmetrical movement and flared elbows (85-88\% accuracy). Table 3 presents the detailed form error detection results by exercise type and error category.

\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Training Performance and Model Generalization}
The training process demonstrated good convergence with the model achieving 88.5\% training accuracy and 92.7\% validation accuracy on our exercise classification task.

The learning curves show steady improvement without significant overfitting, indicating effective regularization through dropout layers in the network architecture. The feature normalization process contributed significantly to model generalization across different users and environments.

For repetition counting accuracy, the system achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.42 repetitions across both exercise types, with slightly better performance for squats compared to push-ups. The state machine approach proved effective at handling the transitions between exercise phases, though rapid or partial repetitions occasionally presented challenges for the counter.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented AI Gym, a comprehensive computer vision-based system for exercise classification, form analysis, and repetition counting. The system combines MediaPipe pose estimation with a custom feature extraction pipeline and TensorFlow Lite model to provide real-time feedback on exercise performance. Our approach emphasizes accessibility, requiring only a standard webcam while achieving high accuracy in exercise classification and form analysis.

The implemented system demonstrates several key technical achievements:
\begin{itemize}
\item A robust pose normalization technique that centers and scales body keypoints to make features invariant to user position, size, and camera angle
\item A state machine approach to track exercise phases and count repetitions, with custom biomechanical rules for different exercise types
\item An intuitive visualization system that provides real-time progress tracking, repetition counting, and form feedback
\item A smoothing mechanism using sliding window average to reduce noise and prevent false detections
\end{itemize}

The current implementation focuses on two primary exercises (push-ups and squats) with detailed form analysis for each. The system successfully tracks exercise progress using relevant joint angles (elbow angle for push-ups, knee angle for squats) and provides appropriate coaching cues based on detected form issues.

While limitations exist, particularly related to single-camera depth perception and performance in challenging environments such as poor lighting or occlusion, AI Gym represents a significant advancement in making professional-quality exercise guidance widely accessible. The system's ability to provide personalized, real-time feedback without specialized equipment democratizes access to proper exercise technique.

Future work will focus on expanding the exercise library beyond the current implementation, implementing multi-view analysis for improved accuracy, developing personalized models that adapt to individual users over time, and validating the system's effectiveness in specialized applications such as physical therapy and athletic training.

\section{Introduction}
Physical exercise is a crucial component of maintaining overall health and wellness. Regular physical activity has been linked to numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, enhanced muscular strength, better mental health, and reduced risk of chronic diseases \cite{warburton2006}. However, many individuals lack access to professional guidance to ensure proper form and technique during workouts, which can lead to suboptimal exercise outcomes, reduced effectiveness, and potential injuries due to improper form.

The fitness industry has responded with technologies including wearable devices, specialized equipment with embedded sensors, and mobile applications with pre-recorded workout videos. These solutions often lacked personalization, real-time feedback, and form correction capabilities that a human trainer would provide. Additionally, specialized fitness equipment can be prohibitively expensive for many users, limiting accessibility to effective training resources.

Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have created opportunities to develop intelligent systems that can automatically track human movements, classify exercises, and provide real-time feedback on form. This paper introduces AI Gym, a system that leverages pose estimation technology and deep learning to detect, classify, and monitor exercise movements using only a standard webcam. The system was designed to be accessible, requiring minimal equipment and setup, while providing valuable feedback comparable to that of a personal trainer.

\subsection{Literature Survey}
Human activity recognition using computer vision has evolved significantly over the past decades. Early approaches relied on handcrafted features extracted from video data to classify human activities \cite{aggarwal2011}. These methods typically involved background subtraction, motion history images, and spatio-temporal interest points to capture human movements, but struggled with variations in lighting, viewpoint, and subject appearance.

The advent of deep learning revolutionized activity recognition research. Simonyan and Zisserman \cite{simonyan2014} introduced the two-stream convolutional network architecture, processing spatial and temporal information separately before fusion. This approach significantly improved activity recognition performance by capturing both appearance and motion cues. Carreira and Zisserman \cite{carreira2017} expanded this work with I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNet), extending 2D CNN architectures to 3D for more effective modeling of spatio-temporal relationships.

Pose-based methods emerged as an alternative approach, first extracting human skeletal pose and then classifying activities based on joint movements. Du et al. \cite{du2015} proposed a hierarchical RNN for skeleton-based action recognition, dividing the human skeleton into five parts and fusing them hierarchically. Yan et al. \cite{yan2018} advanced this with Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN), representing the skeleton as a graph and applying graph convolutions to capture spatial and temporal joint relationships.

In the fitness domain, Lin et al. \cite{lin2020} introduced AutoCoach, combining pose estimation with exercise-specific biomechanical models to detect form errors in weight training exercises. However, AutoCoach requires multiple camera views for optimal performance. Parmar and Morris \cite{parmar2019} proposed methods for evaluating fitness exercise quality using skeletal data from depth sensors, but with limited feedback mechanisms.

MediaPipe \cite{lugaresi2019} emerged as a powerful framework for real-time pose estimation on commodity hardware, enabling applications like exercise tracking. It combines machine learning with custom accelerated pipelines for on-device inference, providing 33 3D landmarks of the human body essential for fitness applications.

\subsection{Methodology}
The AI Gym system implements a modular pipeline for exercise analysis, consisting of five key stages:

First, video input from a standard webcam is captured at 640Ã—480 resolution and processed frame-by-frame. Users can either use a live webcam feed or analyze pre-recorded videos through command-line arguments.

Second, MediaPipe's pose model processes each frame to extract 33 3D body keypoints with a detection confidence threshold of 0.5. These include major joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles) and finer landmarks (facial points, fingers) that enable comprehensive body tracking.

Third, extracted landmarks undergo feature normalization through the PoseFeatureExtractor class. This process centers the coordinates around the body's center of gravity and scales them by torso height, creating pose features that remain consistent regardless of user position, distance from camera, or body proportions.

Fourth, the normalized features are passed to a TensorFlow Lite model that classifies the current exercise. The initial implementation focuses on two primary exercises (push-ups and squats), with the ActivityClassifier using majority voting over a sliding window to provide stable classification results.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/classification_vis_300.png}
    \caption{Real-time Exercise Classification with Pose Estimation Overlay. The visualization shows the system's ability to detect and track body landmarks during exercise execution. The skeletal overlay (blue lines) connects key joints, while the exercise type is displayed in the upper corner. This real-time feedback helps users understand how the system is interpreting their movements and provides immediate classification results.}
    \label{fig:classification_vis}
\end{figure}

Fifth, the RepetitionCounter class implements a state machine approach for each exercise type, tracking transitions between defined states (e.g., "up" and "down" positions). For push-ups, the system monitors elbow angles (90$^\circ$ to 160$^\circ$) and hip alignment (>160$^\circ$ for proper form), while for squats, knee angles (90$^\circ$ to 170$^\circ$) are the primary tracking metric.

Finally, the ExerciseVisualizer renders real-time feedback elements, including a progress bar showing exercise position, repetition counter, form feedback text, and exercise type label. The visualization uses color-coding to provide intuitive feedback: green for progress indicators, red for count numbers, and white backgrounds with colored text for feedback cues.

For push-ups, the system monitors elbow angles (shown in green) and hip alignment. For squats, knee angle and torso position are tracked. These angle measurements drive both the repetition counting state machine and form feedback mechanisms, enabling precise assessment of exercise quality.}
    \label{fig:biomechanics_vis}
\end{figure}

The pipeline operates in real-time, with frame rates between 12-28 FPS depending on hardware capabilities, providing immediate feedback as users perform exercises.

\section{Model}

\subsection{Architecture of Existing Model}
Traditional exercise recognition systems typically employed either handcrafted feature extraction methods or simple feed-forward neural networks applied to raw pose data. These approaches often struggled with variations in user physiology, camera positioning, and exercise execution style.

Conventional pose-based exercise recognition systems commonly utilized one of two approaches:

1) Direct classification of raw keypoint coordinates using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), represented as:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \sigma(W_2 \cdot \sigma(W_1 \cdot X + b_1) + b_2)
\end{equation}

where $X$ contains the raw 3D coordinates of 33 body keypoints directly from the pose estimator, $W_1$ and $W_2$ are weight matrices that the network learns during training, and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are bias vectors. The function $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function like ReLU.

2) Extraction of joint angles as features followed by classification, represented as:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{ijk} = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{(\vec{v}{ij} \cdot \vec{v}{jk})}{|\vec{v}{ij}||\vec{v}{jk}|}\right)
\end{equation}

where vectors $\vec{v}{ij}$ and $\vec{v}{jk}$ represent the direction from joint $i$ to $j$ and from joint $j$ to $k$ respectively.

For form analysis, existing systems typically implemented rule-based methods with fixed thresholds:

\begin{equation}
\text{FormError} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \theta < \theta_{\text{min}} \text{ or } \theta > \theta_{\text{max}} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Difference Between Classical and Proposed Model}
Our proposed model differs from classical approaches in several key mathematical aspects:

First, we implement a comprehensive keypoint normalization procedure that transforms raw coordinates into a standardized reference frame, addressing the limitations of direct classification methods. For a set of keypoints $X \in \mathbb{R}^{33 \times 3}$, we compute:

\begin{equation}
X_{\text{norm}} = \frac{X - C_g}{L_{\text{body}}}
\end{equation}

where $C_g$ is the center of gravity calculated as the weighted mean of all keypoints:

\begin{equation}
C_g = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{33} w_i X_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{33} w_i}
\end{equation}

with weights $w_i$ proportional to the segment masses they represent based on anthropometric data. $L_{\text{body}}$ is the total body length calculated as:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{body}} = L_{\text{head}} + L_{\text{torso}} + L_{\text{leg}}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{head}} = d(\text{Nose}, \text{Neck})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{torso}} = \max(d(\text{Neck}, \text{LHip}), d(\text{Neck}, \text{RHip}))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{leg}} = \max(L_{\text{leg\left}}, L{\text{leg\_right}})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{leg\_left}} = d(\text{LHip}, \text{LKnee}) + d(\text{LKnee}, \text{LAnkle})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{leg\_right}} = d(\text{RHip}, \text{RKnee}) + d(\text{RKnee}, \text{RAnkle})
\end{equation}

and $d(p_1, p_2)$ is the Euclidean distance between points $p_1$ and $p_2$.

We also perform rotational normalization by computing the principal axis of the torso as the vector $\vec{v}_{\text{torso}}$ from the mid-point of hip joints to the neck, and applying a rotation matrix $R$ that aligns this vector with the vertical axis:

\begin{equation}
R = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{v}_{\text{torso}}$ and the vertical axis. The normalized keypoints are then calculated as:

\begin{equation}
X_{\text{norm}}' = R \cdot X_{\text{norm}}
\end{equation}

Second, our neural network architecture combines convolutional and recurrent elements to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in exercise movements. For a sequence of normalized keypoints $X_{\text{norm}}' \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times 33 \times 3}$ over $T$ frames, we first extract spatial features $F_s$ and temporal features $F_t$:

\begin{equation}
F_s = \text{Conv1D}(X_{\text{norm}}')
\end{equation}

This equation represents the extraction of spatial features using one-dimensional convolutional neural networks applied to the normalized keypoints sequence.

\begin{equation}
F_t = \text{BiLSTM}(F_s)
\end{equation}

The BiLSTM processes the sequence in both forward and backward directions, capturing the temporal evolution of body positions throughout the exercise.

These features are then combined and passed through fully connected layers:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \text{Softmax}(W_3 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_1 \cdot [F_s; F_t] + b_1) + b_2) + b_3)
\end{equation}

The spatial features $F_s$ and temporal features $F_t$ are concatenated and passed through three fully connected layers with ReLU activations and a final Softmax function.

Third, our form analysis framework implements a dynamic, context-aware approach that models exercises as state machines with biomechanically-informed transition conditions. For example, a push-up is modeled as:

\begin{equation}
S_t = 
\begin{cases}
S_{\text{up}}, & \text{if } \theta_{\text{elbow}} > 160$^\circ$ \\
S_{\text{down}}, & \text{if } \theta_{\text{elbow}} \leq 90$^\circ$ \text{ and } \theta_{\text{hip}} > 160$^\circ$ \\
S_{\text{transitioning}}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This state machine tracks different phases of a push-up exercise based on biomechanically relevant joint angles.

Form errors are detected through multi-dimensional analysis rather than simple thresholds. For instance, "sagging hips" in push-ups are detected by:

\begin{equation}
\text{SaggingHips} = (\theta_{\text{hip}} < 160$^\circ$) \land (|\vec{v}{\text{torso}} \times \vec{v}{\text{leg}}| > \delta)
\end{equation}

This combines hip angle measurement with vector cross product to effectively capture the biomechanical nature of the error.

\subsection{Training and Loss Functions}
The training of our neural network utilizes categorical cross-entropy loss for the multi-class exercise classification task, defined as:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{CE}} = -\sum_{i=1}^{C} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
\end{equation}

For each of the C exercise classes, it multiplies the true label $y_i$ by the logarithm of the predicted probability $\hat{y}_i$.

For the form analysis component, we use binary cross-entropy loss:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{BCE}} = -y \log(\hat{y}) - (1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})
\end{equation}

For binary classification (correct form vs. incorrect form), where $y$ is either 0 or 1, and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted probability.

For evaluation and during development phases, we also utilized Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) metrics. The MSE is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the number of samples.

The derivative of MSE with respect to the model's predictions is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}_i} = \frac{2}{n}(\hat{y}_i - y_i)
\end{equation}

This gradient indicates how the MSE changes as the prediction changes, essential for optimizing the model through gradient descent.

This gradient is used during backpropagation to update the model weights through gradient descent:

\begin{equation}
W_j \leftarrow W_j - \eta \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial W_j}
\end{equation}

where $\eta$ is the learning rate and the gradient of MSE with respect to weights $W_j$ is calculated using the chain rule:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial W_j} = \frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}_i} \frac{\partial \hat{y}_i}{\partial z_i} \frac{\partial z_i}{\partial W_j}
\end{equation}

with $z_i$ being the pre-activation output of the network.

For regression tasks in keypoint prediction, we used the SSE:

\begin{equation}
\text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

with derivative:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \text{SSE}}{\partial \hat{y}_i} = 2(\hat{y}_i - y_i)
\end{equation}

For angle-based form analysis, we defined custom error functions for specific exercise requirements. For example, the squatting depth error is defined as:

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{depth}} = 
\begin{cases}
(\theta_{\text{knee}} - \theta_{\text{target}})^2, & \text{if } \theta_{\text{knee}} > \theta_{\text{target}} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\theta_{\text{knee}}$ is the measured knee angle and $\theta_{\text{target}}$ is the target angle for proper squat depth.

For temporal evaluation of exercise form, we implemented a weighted cumulative error function:

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{cumulative}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} w_t E_t
\end{equation}

where $E_t$ is the error at time $t$, and weights $w_t$ are assigned based on the importance of different phases of the exercise.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{System Architecture}
The AI Gym system consists of five main components working together to provide real-time exercise analysis:

1) \textbf{PoseEstimation}: Interfaces with MediaPipe to extract 33 body landmarks from video frames. The system uses a confidence threshold of 0.5 for both detection and tracking to balance accuracy with processing speed.

2) \textbf{BiomechanicsAnalyzer}: Calculates joint angles using vector mathematics, including elbow angles, knee angles, and hip angles crucial for form analysis. Joint angles are computed using the cosine formula:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{ijk} = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{(\vec{v}{ij} \cdot \vec{v}{jk})}{|\vec{v}{ij}||\vec{v}{jk}|}\right)
\end{equation}

3) \textbf{PoseFeatureExtractor}: Normalizes raw landmark coordinates to make the data invariant to user position, size, and camera setup. The normalization process centers keypoints around a body center of gravity and scales them by the torso height, making the features robust across different users.

4) \textbf{ActivityClassifier}: Implements a TensorFlow Lite model that classifies the normalized pose features into different exercise types. Currently, the system supports squats and pushups with high accuracy.

5) \textbf{RepetitionCounter}: Implements a state-machine approach to track exercise phases and count repetitions. For example, pushups are tracked by monitoring elbow angle transitions between approximately 90$^\circ$ (bottom position) and 160$^\circ$ (top position), while ensuring hip angle remains above 160$^\circ$ to maintain proper form.

The components interact in a processing pipeline where video frames are captured, pose landmarks are extracted, features are computed and normalized, the exercise is classified, and then exercise-specific form analysis and repetition counting are performed.

\subsection{Form Analysis Algorithms}
The form analysis implementation uses a combination of biomechanical principles and empirical thresholds derived from exercise physiology. For example:

For pushups, the system monitors:
\begin{itemize}
\item Elbow angle to ensure full range of motion (between 90$^\circ$ and 160$^\circ$)
\item Hip angle to detect "sagging hips" error (should remain above 160$^\circ$)
\item Arm and shoulder alignment to detect "flared elbows"
\end{itemize}

For squats, the system tracks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Knee angle to ensure proper depth (should drop below 100$^\circ$ at the bottom position)
\item Hip-knee-ankle alignment to detect "knees caving inward"
\item Torso angle to detect excessive forward lean
\end{itemize}

To improve stability and prevent false positives from momentary detection errors, the system implements a position buffer that performs smoothing over 5 frames, using the formula:

\begin{equation}
\text{smoothed\position} = \frac{1}{n} \sum{i=1}^{n} \text{position}_i
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the buffer size (5 in our implementation).

\subsection{Visualization Components}
The ExerciseVisualizer class implements several feedback mechanisms:

1) Progress bar: A vertical bar showing the current position within the exercise range of motion, calculated by mapping joint angles to percentage values (e.g., knee angle from 90$^\circ$ to 170$^\circ$ maps to 0-100\% for squats).

2) Repetition counter: A prominent display showing the count of completed repetitions.

3) Form feedback: Text feedback providing specific coaching cues based on detected errors (e.g., "Keep back straight", "Squat deeper").

4) Exercise label: Displays the currently detected exercise type.

The visualization components use OpenCV drawing functions with a consistent color scheme: green for progress indicators, red for the repetition counter, and white backgrounds with colored text for feedback and exercise type labels.

\section{Results}

\subsection{System Requirements}
The AI Gym system was implemented using the following technology stack: Python 3.8 for core development, TensorFlow 2.5 as the deep learning framework, OpenCV 4.5 and MediaPipe 0.8.9 for computer vision components, and PyQt5 for the desktop user interface.

The minimum hardware requirements for real-time performance  are:
\begin{itemize}
\item CPU: Intel Core i3 or equivalent (4 threads recommended)
\item RAM: 4GB minimum
\item Camera: Standard webcam (720p or higher)
\item Storage: 100MB for the application
\end{itemize}

Performance evaluation across different hardware platforms demonstrated that the system maintained usable frame rates even on modest hardware. Table 1 presents the computational performance metrics across various hardware configurations.

\end{table}

On mid-range laptops (Intel i5, 8GB RAM), the system achieved over 20 FPS, providing smooth feedback with minimal latency.

\subsection{Dataset and Classification Performance}
We evaluated our model using data from 30 participants performing two different exercises (push-ups and squats) with both correct and deliberately incorrect form. The participants varied in height, weight, gender, and fitness level to ensure robust model training.

Table 2 presents the statistics of our dataset, showing the number of samples used for each exercise type. The data was split into training (70\%), validation (15\%), and test (15\%) sets.

    \caption{Exercise Class Distribution in Training Dataset. This visualization shows the balanced distribution of exercise samples used for training our model. A balanced dataset helps prevent bias toward any particular exercise type and improves generalization across different movements. In our implementation, we focused on push-ups and squats as the primary exercise categories.}
    \label{fig:class_distribution_detail}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Dataset Statistics by Exercise Type}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Exercise Type} & \textbf{Training} & \textbf{Validation} & \textbf{Test} \\
\hline
Push-ups & 240 & 40 & 60 \\
\hline
Squats & 255 & 42 & 68 \\

\textbf{Total} & \textbf{495} & \textbf{82} & \textbf{128} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:dataset}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The average precision, recall, and F1-score across all exercise categories were 0.972, 0.973, and 0.972 respectively, demonstrating strong overall performance. Even the most challenging category (burpees) achieved an F1-score of 0.947, indicating the model's robustness across diverse exercise types.

The matrix displays the classification accuracy for each exercise type, with darker diagonal elements indicating higher correct classification rates. This visualization helps identify which exercises might be challenging for the model to distinguish. Our system achieves high accuracy in differentiating between push-ups and squats (the main focus of our implementation), with minimal confusion between these categories.}
    \label{fig:confusion_matrix_detail}
\end{figure}

For form analysis, the system achieved an average accuracy of 90.8\% in detecting improper technique. Performance varied by error type, with range of motion and depth errors detected with higher accuracy (greater than 92\%) compared to more subtle errors like asymmetrical movement and flared elbows (85-88\% accuracy). Table 3 presents the detailed form error detection results by exercise type and error category.

\textbf{Exercise} & \textbf{Error Category} & \textbf{Accuracy (\%)} \\
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Push-ups} & Sagging hips & 93.2 \\
\cline{2-3}
 & Incomplete range of motion & 91.5 \\
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Squats} & Improper depth & 94.8 \\

\hline
\textbf{Overall Average} & & \textbf{92.2} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:form_accuracy}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Training Performance and Model Generalization}
The training process demonstrated good convergence with the model achieving 88.5\% training accuracy and 92.7\% validation accuracy on our exercise classification task.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/training_history.png}
    \caption{Model Training and Validation Metrics Over Epochs. This graph shows the progression of model accuracy and loss during training. The steady improvement in validation accuracy (reaching over 90\%) with minimal gap between training and validation curves indicates effective learning without overfitting. The convergence pattern demonstrates that our normalization approach and model architecture successfully capture the essential features of each exercise type while generalizing well to unseen data.}
    \label{fig:training_history}
\end{figure}

The learning curves show steady improvement without significant overfitting, indicating effective regularization through dropout layers in the network architecture. The feature normalization process contributed significantly to model generalization across different users and environments.

For repetition counting accuracy, the system achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.42 repetitions across both exercise types, with slightly better performance for squats compared to push-ups. The state machine approach proved effective at handling the transitions between exercise phases, though rapid or partial repetitions occasionally presented challenges for the counter.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented AI Gym, a comprehensive computer vision-based system for exercise classification, form analysis, and repetition counting. The system combines MediaPipe pose estimation with a custom feature extraction pipeline and TensorFlow Lite model to provide real-time feedback on exercise performance. Our approach emphasizes accessibility, requiring only a standard webcam while achieving high accuracy in exercise classification and form analysis.

The implemented system demonstrates several key technical achievements:
\begin{itemize}
\item A robust pose normalization technique that centers and scales body keypoints to make features invariant to user position, size, and camera angle
\item A state machine approach to track exercise phases and count repetitions, with custom biomechanical rules for different exercise types
\item An intuitive visualization system that provides real-time progress tracking, repetition counting, and form feedback
\item A smoothing mechanism using sliding window average to reduce noise and prevent false detections
\end{itemize}

The current implementation focuses on two primary exercises (push-ups and squats) with detailed form analysis for each. The system successfully tracks exercise progress using relevant joint angles (elbow angle for push-ups, knee angle for squats) and provides appropriate coaching cues based on detected form issues.

While limitations exist, particularly related to single-camera depth perception and performance in challenging environments such as poor lighting or occlusion, AI Gym represents a significant advancement in making professional-quality exercise guidance widely accessible. The system's ability to provide personalized, real-time feedback without specialized equipment democratizes access to proper exercise technique.

Future work will focus on expanding the exercise library beyond the current implementation, implementing multi-view analysis for improved accuracy, developing personalized models that adapt to individual users over time, and validating the system's effectiveness in specialized applications such as physical therapy and athletic training.
